UTA Data Bootcamp Project 1, Group 6 (Mon-Wed)

### Purpose
This project will examine the relationship between property values and racial demographics in the zip codes areas of Austin, TX from 2011-2017.

### Hypothesis
H-Null: Rising property values do not signal any changes in the racial makeup of the zip code areas within Austin.

H-Alt: Rising property values in Austin are correlated with zip code areas becoming less diverse over time.

### Data Sources
